            Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes in their 
            codebase. It is widely used in the software development industry and is an 
            essential tool for any developer. Git is more powerful than other version 
            control systems because it allows developers to work on multiple branches 
            of code at the same time. This means that developers can work on new features 
            or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are several best practices that developers should follow when using Git.
            These best practices include using descriptive commit messages, keeping commits
            small and focused, and using branches to organize code changes. Using
            descriptive commit messages is important because it helps other developers
            understand the changes that have been made to the codebase. Keeping commits
            small and focused is also important because it makes it easier to review.
          </p>

            The best practices for Git are important because they help developers work more
            efficiently and effectively. By following these best practices, developers would
            be able to know the reasons behind the changes that have been made to the codebase. 
            This would help them understand the code better and make it easier to work with.
          </p>
          <p>The 5 best practices for Git are as follows:</p>
          <ol className='pt-1 pb-5 font-stretch-50%'>
            <li>Use descriptive commit messages: When making a commit, it is important to use a
              descriptive commit message that explains what changes have been made to the codebase.
              This helps other developers understand the changes that have been made and makes it
              easier to review the code.</li>
            <li className='pt-2'>Keep commits small and focused: It is important to keep commits small and focused on a
              specific change. This makes it easier to review the code and understand the changes that
              have been made. It also makes it easier to revert changes if necessary.</li>
            <li className='pt-2'>Use branches to organize code changes: Git allows developers to create branches to work on
              new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. This is a powerful feature of Git.</li>
            <li className='pt-2'>Use pull requests to review code changes: When making changes to the codebase, it is important to use
              pull requests to review the changes before they are merged into the main codebase. This helps ensure that
              the changes are reviewed and approved by other developers before they are merged into the main codebase.</li>
            <li className='pt-2'>
              Use tags to mark important milestones: Git allows developers to create tags to mark important milestones in the codebase.
            </li>
          </ol>
