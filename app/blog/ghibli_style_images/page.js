                            ChatGPT&apos;s is one of the most commonly used AI tool in the world and it is
                            used by many people for many purposes. It is used for writing, coding,
                            generating images, and many more. It is a great tool for people who are
                            looking for help in their work. For example, if you are a student and you are
                            looking for help in your assignments, you can use ChatGPT to get help.
                            <br /> <br />
                            If this technology is used in a good way, it can be very helpful for people.
                            But if it is used in a bad way, it can be very dangerous. As its a peace 
                            of code that is written by a human, if someone gains a control over the 
                            data that could be provided by you to the AI they could exactly predict
                            what you are doing or what you are thinking.
                            <br /> <br />
                            ChatGPT&apos;s native image generation capabilities were introduced since 
                            the last update but people have become soo obsessed with one of its 
                            style which is <mark>Studio Ghibli-style images</mark>and they are 
                            enjyoing it a lot, but they are forgetting that its an AI. As AI are 
                            the kind of technology that learns from the inputs provided to it, 
                            so as of now it may not affect the people but in the future it may 
                            affect the people a lot, as it may use your pictures to genereate some
                            new images and it may be used in any criminal activities. Even though 
                            as the technologies are made to help people we should know what we 
                            should be sharing. So, be careful while using it. 
                            <br /> <br />
                            Final thoughts, I would say that ChatGPT is a great tool for people 
                            who are looking for help in their work. But we should be careful 
                            while using it. We should not share our personal information with 
                            it.
